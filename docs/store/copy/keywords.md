## iOS App Store Keywords

**Character Limit:** 100 characters (comma-separated, no spaces)

### Primary Keyword String
```
teen,social,chat,messaging,friends,community,safe,privacy,moderation,connect,high school,college
```
(98 characters)

### Alternative Variations (A/B Test)
```
teen,safe,chat,school,friends,messaging,community,moderation,privacy,anonymous,connect,support

**Tips:**

- Avoid duplicates with app name or subtitle
- Don't use special characters or competitor names
- Prioritize keywords that balance volume + relevance
- Update after launch based on Search Ads data

---

## Google Play Store Strategy

Google Play does **not** have a dedicated keywords field. SEO is driven by:

1. **App Name** – Includes primary keyword (e.g., "TeenTalk – Safe Social for Teens")
2. **Short Description** – First 80 characters prioritized in search (see `google-play-en.md`)
3. **Full Description** – Natural keyword integration
4. **Developer Name** – Can include keywords if applicable

### Keywords to Naturally Integrate in Description

**Primary:**
- teen social app
- safe messaging
- school community
- anonymous posting
- moderated social network
- privacy-first

**Secondary:**
- high school social
- connect with peers
- teen friends
- COPPA compliant
- no ads, no tracking

**Tertiary:**
- trust badges
- direct messages
- parental consent
- mental health support (future feature)

### Keyword Density Best Practices
- Use primary keywords **2-3 times** in full description
- Avoid keyword stuffing (penalty risk)
- Write naturally for readers, not just algorithms

---

## Localized Keywords

### Italian (it-IT)

**Primary:**
- social per adolescenti
- app per ragazzi
- chat sicura
- community scolastica
- pubblicazione anonima
- messaggi privati
- moderazione

**iOS Keyword String (Italian):**
```
teen,social,chat,sicura,ragazzi,scuola,amici,community,moderazione,privacy,anonima,messaggi
```
(96 characters)
