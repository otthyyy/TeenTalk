**Welcome to TeenTalk – Your Safe Space to Connect**

TeenTalk is a social platform designed exclusively for teens who want to share their thoughts, connect with peers, and express themselves in a safe, welcoming environment. Built with privacy, safety, and inclusivity at its core, TeenTalk brings together teens from schools across the country.

**🌟 Key Features**

**Community Feed**
Browse a vibrant feed of posts from your school community and beyond. Discover trending topics, participate in discussions, and see what's on everyone's mind. Like, comment, and share your thoughts on posts that resonate with you.

**Anonymous Posting (Spotted)**
Sometimes you just need to speak freely without judgment. Our "Spotted" feature lets you post anonymously to your school community – share observations, ask questions, or express yourself while maintaining your privacy.

**Direct Messages**
Connect privately with friends through secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. Share thoughts, plan hangouts, and keep the conversation going in a safe space.

**Smart Moderation**
Our community-driven moderation tools help keep TeenTalk a positive space. Report inappropriate content, and know that trained moderators review every report to ensure community guidelines are upheld.

**Trust Badges**
Build your reputation in the community! Earn trust badges (Newcomer, Member, Trusted, Veteran) based on your activity and positive contributions. Trust levels help create a safer environment for everyone.

**Privacy First**
We believe your data is yours. TeenTalk complies with COPPA, GDPR, and strict privacy standards. Control who sees your posts, manage your profile visibility, and opt out of analytics at any time. No ads, no tracking, no selling your data.

**Notifications & Alerts**
Stay in the loop with instant notifications for likes, comments, new messages, and community updates. Customize what you see to avoid notification overload.

**Light & Dark Mode**
Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing any time of day. The app automatically adapts to your device settings.

**📱 Designed for Teens, By Teens**

We worked with real high school and college students to build TeenTalk. Every feature reflects what teens actually want: a place to connect without judgment, share authentically, and feel heard.

With bold colors, smooth animations, and intuitive navigation, TeenTalk feels modern and fun. The app is designed to be accessible for everyone, with support for larger text sizes and screen readers.
