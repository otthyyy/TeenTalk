⚠️ IMPORTANT: Firebase Configuration Required ⚠️

This repository no longer contains Firebase credentials for security reasons.

Before you can run the app, you MUST configure Firebase:

QUICK START:
1. Install FlutterFire CLI:
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

2. Configure Firebase:
   flutterfire configure

3. This will create the required firebase_options.dart file

Alternatively, see FIREBASE_SECURITY.md for manual setup instructions.

For CI/CD, see README.md section "🔐 Firebase Setup → CI/CD Pipelines"

For full security documentation, see:
- FIREBASE_SECURITY.md - Comprehensive setup guide
- SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md - Security incident details
- README.md - Updated with Firebase setup section
